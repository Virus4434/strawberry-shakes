                    vegetables, non-dairy milk, crushed ice, whey powder or nutritional supplements.</p>

           Many smoothies include large or multiple servings of fruits and vegetables,

      <p class="sectag">History of smoothie</p>
      <p class="secsubtag">Health food stores on the West Coast of the United States began selling smoothies with the invention
         of the electric blender.The actual term "smoothie" was being used in recipes and trademarks by the mid-1980s. 
         In the 1960s Steve Kuhnau was inspired by his work as a soda jerk and began experimenting with smoothies. 
         They were an alternative for the lactose intolerant Kuhnau to taste his own concoctions using unique blends of fruit juices,
          vegetables, protein powder, and vitamins. Kuhnau discovered early success in his smoothie sales and founded Smoothie King.
           Smoothie King expanded throughout the United States and would pioneer other smoothie businesses such as Jamba Juice.
            The smoothie was then modified by fast food chains with the addition of sweeter ingredients like chocolate and Splenda.In the 2000s,
         consumers began making smoothies at home, in part as an alternative for daily consumption of fruits and vegetables.</p>
